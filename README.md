## Development with Air

Air is set up for hot reloading to automatically restart the application on code changes. To use it:
- Ensure Air is installed (e.g., via `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`).
- Run `air` in the project root to start the server.
This improves development efficiency by eliminating manual restarts.
