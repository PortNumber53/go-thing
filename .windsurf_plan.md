# AI Agent Improvement Plan

## Objectives
- Add a chat interface for the AI agent to handle user inputs via chat and call tools.
- Implement a write_file tool restricted to a specific folder, with configuration in `~/.config/go-thing/config`.

## Steps
1. [x] Set up configuration file for restricted directory.
2. [x] Modify `toolserver.go` to implement secure write_file tool.
3. [x] Enhance `agent.go` for chat interface and tool integration.

## Updates
- Created config file at `~/.config/go-thing/config` with `write_dir` set to `/home/grimlock/work/go-thing/files`.
- Modified `toolserver.go` to implement a secure write_file tool that reads the config and restricts writes to the specified directory.
- Added terminal check to prevent hangs in non-interactive environments.
- Added debug logging for exit condition.
- Confirmed resolution of hanging issue with 'air' after adding terminal check and debug logging.

## Next Steps
1. Enhance `agent.go` chat interface for better tool integration.
2. Test the write_file functionality.

## Debugging Agent Hanging Issue
The agent hangs when started with 'air' but works with 'go run'. Added detailed logs and flushed output to diagnose. Addressing lint errors (unreachable code, defers). Cause may be Air's signal handling or buffering.

## Task List
- [x] Research Air installation and configuration for Go projects
- [x] Add Air as a development dependency (via binary or config)
- [x] Create or update .air.toml configuration file as needed
- [x] Update documentation with instructions for using Air
- [x] Test hot reloading to confirm it works as expected
- [x] Debug agent hanging issue in agent.go (resolved)
- [x] Fix 'exit' command not stopping the agent (attempt)
- [x] Add logging for input handling and retest
- [x] Add detailed debugging for chat message handling
- [x] Fix Air-specific hanging and lint errors
- [x] Retest with Air

## Current Goal
